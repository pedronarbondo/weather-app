Created with create-react-app

This was a personal project (though it was featured on The Odin Project as one of their landmark projects) with which I attempted to deepen my practical knowledge on React. Working with APIs felt better here and I now feel more comfortable with React Hooks and components. I still have some work to do with more complex hooks, like useContext, in order to avoid some prop-drilling that happened while moving the API data around.
